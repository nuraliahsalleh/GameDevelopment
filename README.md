# GameDevelopment
WIRA RIMBA GAME, this project aims to design and develop a computer game based on traditional Malay pantun (quatrains) in an interactive 3D exploration format. The findings indicate that interactive and educational game elements can enhance users' interest in understanding and applying pantun.

Third-Person 3D Perspective
The player controls Jati from a third-person perspective to restore harmony in Hutan Pantun (the Pantun Forest).

Game Levels:
Level 1 – Challenge of Wisdom (Collecting Trash)

Level 2 – Challenge of Courage (Avoiding Thorny Objects)

Level 3 – Challenge of Perseverance (Finding Items Based on Riddle Pantuns)

Gameplay Mechanics & Interaction:
1) The game is played on a computer, where the main character uses stamina as a form of health.
2) In each level, the player must go through exploration challenges. At the end of each level, the player must answer a randomly generated pantun riddle that introduces a new challenge and provides clues to progress.
3) Players can interact by jumping, and moving forward, backward, left, and right to overcome the obstacles.
